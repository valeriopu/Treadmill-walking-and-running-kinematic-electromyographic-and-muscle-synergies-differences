## Treadmill-walking-and-running-kinematic-electromyographic-and-muscle-synergies-differences

The purpose of the project, carried out during the `Neuroengineering` university course, is three-fold: itâ€™s proposed the analysis and the comment of the results obtained comparing both treadmill walking (1.4 m/s) and running (2.8 m/s) tasks, carried out by a group of 30 young adults, kinematically, ectromyographically and focusing on the muscle synergy recruitment. 

In particular, the parameters taken into account among the investigation are: 
- stance
- swing and cadence (kinematic)
- time-normalized to gait-cycle length sEMG envelopes (electromyography) and motor modules and primitives (muscle synergies). 

The entire work, from data acquisition to data processing and evaluation, has been done in `Matlab`.
